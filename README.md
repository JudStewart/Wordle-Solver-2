# WordleSolver

A sequel an old C# program I wrote, with some extra features and some of the kinks worked out.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

## How it works

Type in as many guesses as you'd like (not limited to 5 in order for compatibility with games like [Dordle](dordle.io/) and [Quordle](quordle.com/)). Click a letter to change its color to match what's given in the game, and then hit enter to see a list of valid guesses. Note that some words from non-Wordle games may not be present in the word pool. Sorry about that.

## Options

Hit the gear icon in the top right for settings. Presently, there are options for dark mode and high contrast mode.
